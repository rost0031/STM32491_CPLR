This library and code for it come from http://code.google.com/p/protobuf-embedded-c/

The jar file is usable to build message buffers (see makefiles for how) or check the project
documentation on the website.  The directory edu.tum.cs.ccts.protobuf.embedded contains the
entire SVN source directory checked out directly from the website.  Follow their directions
if the protoc-1.0M2 jar file needs to be rebuilt for some reason but basically, you need
Java and Ant installed to compile it.
